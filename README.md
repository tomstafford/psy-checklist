## psy-checklist

Atal Gawande's The Checklist Manifesto is a compelling account of how the simple checklist can scaffold expertise and teamwork in complex domains. Good checklists, he says, nudge our memories, prompting us to do what we already know we should do, but risk missing.

Good checklists are also short. 5-9 "killer" items, says Gawande. 

So, I got to thinking, what would be on my checklist for experiment design. Additional suggestions welcome, by email or tweet, but this is what I got so far:

### Experiment Design Checklist

A checklist for 

* did you discuss authorship with the research team?
* is your study adequately powered?  
* can you recruit enough participants?
* should you include a manipulation check?
* how will you judge the size of any effect?
* will you be able to interpret all the results which aren't in line with your predictions?

* do you have a plan (and consent) for storing and sharing the data?
* have you checked prior work on this topic?
* how will the final result be criticised?





# List #2 Common criticisms

\- 

* placebo effect
* demand effect
* regression to the mean
* common method variance
* so what?
